### Recorder

1. replace the source folder of the microbit-v2-samples and built it to get the MICROBIT.hex
   - or you can directly drag in the MICROBIT.hex file in this folder to your board
2. Install all the modules in the import part of the python file
3. change the name of the serial port and the directory and filename for the output file to fit your device
4. run the python file, keypress 's' to start recording, 'q' to stop recording, and the WAV file will be saved to the directory you named
   - there is an example WAV file in this folder as well
